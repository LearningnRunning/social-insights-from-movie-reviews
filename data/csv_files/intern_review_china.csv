伊拉克洗衣粉,全靠德尼罗撑着。前半段好看，后半段价值观温吞保守又缩回去了。德尼罗的人设过于完美了一点,"It all depends on De Niro.The first half looked good, the second half values swallowed conservative and retreated.De Niro's people are a little too perfect.","It all depends on De Niro.The first half looked good, the second half values swallowed conservative and retreated.De Niro's people are a little too perfect.",2015-10-04 11:42:38

张佳玮,当年海瑟薇介入斯特里普的女强人生活，现在德尼罗反侵海瑟薇的生活……其实有点野心的，想讨论事业女性和长不大一代的问题，但浮了点。我挺喜欢海瑟薇，但她的每个小表情都有种演练好了放出来的感觉，尤其跟德尼罗那份从容自在相比。另外德尼罗真的好帅……………,"When Hathaway intervened in Streep's strongwoman life, now De Niro anti-invasion Hathaway life……actually a little ambitious, trying to discuss career women and the older generation, but floating a bit.I like Hathaway a lot, but every little expression of her has a sense of rehearsal and release, especially compared to De Niro's relaxed share.And De Niro is really handsome...…………","When Hathaway intervened in Streep's strongwoman life, now De Niro anti-invasion Hathaway life……actually a little ambitious, trying to discuss career women and the older generation, but floating a bit.I like Hathaway a lot, but every little expression of her has a sense of rehearsal and release, especially compared to De Niro's relaxed share.And De Niro is really handsome...…………",2016-01-25 21:14:56
同志亦凡人中文站,好久没看到安妮公主了，有种久别重逢的喜悦，但电影感觉就是麻麻，尤其在“时尚女魔头”把职业女性和老少配标杆都立得那么高之后，这部也太温吞中庸了吧——缺少化学反应的两主角就像在互发好人卡...,"It's been a long time since I've seen Princess Anne, but the movie feels numb, especially after ""Fashion Witch"" has set the bar so high for professional women and young people, it's also too warm and mediocre.。。","It's been a long time since I've seen Princess Anne, but the movie feels numb, especially after ""Fashion Witch"" has set the bar so high for professional women and young people, it's also too warm and mediocre.。。",2015-09-24 19:25:27

杨欢喜Metiche,电影的新颖在于正视与平衡。70岁的人正视自己与社会的现状，不倚老卖老，不强调过去，只是默默地凭借自己的经验帮助每一个年轻人也继续实现自己的价值。30岁的人逐渐学会平衡生活的所有事情，不逃避婚姻中的问题，也不要刻意遏制内心的渴望。这两件事都很难。但永远不放弃学习的热情和开始的勇气。,"The novelty of the film lies in balance and balance.Seventy-year-olds face up to their own social status quo, do not rely on the old to sell the old, do not emphasize the past, but silently rely on their own experience to help each young person continue to achieve their own value.30-year-olds gradually learn to balance everything in life, not to run away from problems in marriage, and not to deliberately curb their inner desires.Both things are difficult.But never give up the enthusiasm to learn and the courage to start.","The novelty of the film lies in balance and balance.Seventy-year-olds face up to their own social status quo, do not rely on the old to sell the old, do not emphasize the past, but silently rely on their own experience to help each young person continue to achieve their own value.30-year-olds gradually learn to balance everything in life, not to run away from problems in marriage, and not to deliberately curb their inner desires.Both things are difficult.But never give up the enthusiasm to learn and the courage to start.",2015-12-21 2:26:00

Lycidas,Nancy Meyers几年没拍片还是变不出什么新花样，真是几十年如一日专注老年人社交关系鸡汤，老路数还是颇动人，加上与时俱进的start-up/female entrepreneur设定比前作有趣多了，但剧情走向和人物性格实在太理想化了，真怀疑她是不是活在网络文学里。,"Nancy Meyers hasn't made a movie in years, and she's been focusing on old people's social relationships for decades, and her up-to-date start-up/female entrepreneurial setting is much more interesting than before.","Nancy Meyers hasn't made a movie in years, and she's been focusing on old people's social relationships for decades, and her up-to-date start-up/female entrepreneurial setting is much more interesting than before.",2015-12-14 15:15:27

小斑,政治正确，选材有趣，卡司强劲。但全片都透着一股子尴尬无力感。除了主线戏剧张力弱，老头儿性格无聊，叙事散漫，主角没有化学反应，还有Holm演得瞎烂这些因素之外，他们住的房子用的办公室都特么太像样板房/旅馆了。看着就没人味儿。安妮又开时装秀，然而衣服搭配也不是太出彩。,"Politically correct, interesting material selection, strong Cas.But the whole movie is full of embarrassment and helplessness.Apart from the weak tension in the mainline drama, the old man's boring personality, the loose narrative, the protagonist's lack of chemistry, and the fact that Holm is blind, the office they live in is too much like a model house/hotel.It's no use looking at it.Annie started the fashion show again, but the clothes didn't match too well.","Politically correct, interesting material selection, strong Cas.But the whole movie is full of embarrassment and helplessness.Apart from the weak tension in the mainline drama, the old man's boring personality, the loose narrative, the protagonist's lack of chemistry, and the fact that Holm is blind, the office they live in is too much like a model house/hotel.It's no use looking at it.Annie started the fashion show again, but the clothes didn't match too well.",2015-10-30 5:49:07

Morning,加班夜谈到本回到原来工作的那个地方工作，由空间布置到大梧桐，是非常感人的。作为新创业公司的办公室场景来说，只突出了那个无人收拾的办公桌，和用了几次的会议室，没有很好的场景感。桥段是非常陈旧的，尤其四男士偷电脑一段，简直是向当代“喜剧”的妥协。罗伯特德尼罗表演上乘，可惜人物太暖。,"Overtime night talking about Ben back to work in the original place, arranged by the space to the big paulownia, is very touching.As a new start-up office scene, only highlights the unattended desk, and the conference room used several times, there is no good sense of scene.The bridge section is very old, especially the four men stealing a computer section, which is a compromise to the contemporary ""comedy"".Robert De Niro performed well, but the characters were too warm.","Overtime night talking about Ben back to work in the original place, arranged by the space to the big paulownia, is very touching.As a new start-up office scene, only highlights the unattended desk, and the conference room used several times, there is no good sense of scene.The bridge section is very old, especially the four men stealing a computer section, which is a compromise to the contemporary ""comedy"".Robert De Niro performed well, but the characters were too warm.",2016-01-05 15:55:50

 Fortunately, my partner hasn't cheated, but I'm not the one who broke up when I feel cheated. I understand Jules' feelings too well, but I'm still in love. How can I just let go of it? I don't think I'll ever forgive you, but at least I don't think we have to break up.

So the insurance company must pay a high claim to the company that is suspected of oppressing the laborers, in order to compensate the company's loss ~ the life and death of the employees are not considered ~@_@

This type of policy encourages the heads of these multinational corporations and multinational consortiums to take a shortcut to the bonuses.

When the lack of compensation and high work pressure can injure, maim and kill more and more local employees, the unscrupulous corporations will get the money from the insurance companies.
The more insurance claims the unscrupulous corporation can extract from the insurance company, the more the organization's profitability will increase.
The more money they can extract from insurance companies in the form of insurance claims, the higher the profitability of the organization will be.
